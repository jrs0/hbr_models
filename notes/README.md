This repository was intended to hold a prototype calculation of the ARC-HBR score in a framework that is extensible to other risk scores, and separates out the part that calculates the score from the part that obtains and preprocesses the data. The idea with splitting out these components is to be able to reuse the actual score calculation, but swap out the preprocessing logic for something that can connect and automatically get data from hospital systems, for use as part of developing a clinical tool.

This folder contains notes relating to that plan. Most of this repository is focussed on modelling bleeding/ischaemia risk using HES/SWD data, in a form that can be systematically turned into a quarto document to compare models. This relates to a risk prediction tool that is more complex than the ARC-HBR score, which uses machine learning to make the risk predictions. Finding out how well these models perform is largely orthogonal to developing the tool itself (i.e. the preprocessing/architecture/automation), and the modelling code should be treated as prototype work.
