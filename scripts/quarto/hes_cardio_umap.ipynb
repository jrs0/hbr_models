        "Diagnosis and procedure code data present in the hospital episode statistics (HES) administrative database may provide a wealth of predictive information about patient outcomes, but which is very difficult to access due to the difficulty involved reducing the data to a form suitable for use in predictive modelling. For example, subsequent bleeding following an index event may be predictable by looking at prior bleeding, which amounts to finding instances of bleeding diagnosis codes in the HES data. This amounts to formulating a list of bleeding codes, and reducing the prior spells to a yes/no question of whether one of these codes is present. As more predictors are added (for example, prior cardiovascular conditions, prior cancer, etc.), the number of different groups of codes multiples. In addition, within in group, a complex array of choices are made regarding which codes to include or exclude, which multiply to create a large amount of ad-hoc decisions in the preprocessing of predictors prior to formulating a predictive model.\n",

        "This document contains a proof-of-principle demonstrating the use of uniform manifold dimension reduction (UMAP) to reduce the clinical code dimensions from approximately 15,000 to two, for the purpose of visualisation of the spell data in two dimensions. Visualisation is not the end result of the computation; the intention is to use the resulting smaller set of variables (here, 2) as predictors in machine learning models, in place of predictors derived from manually-created code groups. However, the visualisation of the dimension reduction allows some initial sanity checks to be performed on the reduction, to help indicate whether it is worthwhile attempting to develop the resulting models. This includes the following qualitative analysis:\n",
        "* Does the reduction to two dimensions look as if it contains any structure, or does it just look like uniformly random noise? This may help indicate whether any predictive information is likely contained in the reduction.\n",
        "* Do factors of interest (such as bleeding spells, CV spells, or other information such as patient age) display any correlations with the structure of the reduction? If so, then machine learning models may be able to use these patterns. If no patterns exist, then it would seem unlikely the reduction contains any relevant information of interest\n",
        "* How does the reduction vary depending on the hyperparameters of the reduction algorithm (UMAP)? Ideally, it should be relatively robust (i.e. the answers to the above two questions should not depend sensitively on the parameters).\n",

        "If these questions give positive answers, then the reduction to a higher number of dimensions (from 15,000 down to N, where N is larger than 3), which cannot be visualised, may also contain useful information, and may also retain more usable information in machine learning models. These reduced dimensions could then be taken as the starting point for model development that lacks some of the arbitrariness inherent in choosing clinical code groups manually.\n",

        "\n",
        "The observation motivating dimension reduction for diagnosis and procedure code data is that similar hospital episodes may be coded in a similar way, even if the episode involves a complex mix of different codes. Instead of attempting to characterise what codes are present, what is really desirable is being able to characterise the combination of codes. This is what dimension reduction aims to achieve, by combining many different codes (each of which is a single dimension) into fewer variables which better expresses the difference between the spells.\n",
        "\n",
        "The disadvantage of dimension reduction is that it is not possible to interpret the resulting dimensions. However, a spell containing a similar mix of clinical codes will map to similar points in the reduction. This property may has been investigated in a qualitative way be showing where different types of medical condition lie in a plot of the reduced codes. In many cases, they bunch together into regions, which indicates that they started out with a similar mix set of codes (being close together in the reduced plot means that the original spells shared many clinical codes). This holds to varying degrees for the medical conditions plotted above.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reduction is not useful if it cannot distinguish between different types of spells; this is only possible if the clusters corresponding to different types of medical condition are far apart. It is also true that different medical conditions often appeared in different regions of the reduced plot in the graphs above, indicating that they have predominantly distinct sets of clinical codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that, in this version of the application of UMAP, each spell was considered as a set of clinical codes, and similarity between spells was measured by the amount of codes in common. The order of the codes (in terms of primary/secondary positions) was not taken into account. If this were included, further information may be obtainable from each spell. Although this information may not be visible in a plot, it may still improve machine learning algorithms, and should therefore be tested.\n",
        "\n",
        "The conclusions above, that different types of hospital interaction seem broadly separated by the dimension reduction technique, provides evidence that the same may be true in higher dimensions (e.g. 3, 4. 5, ... N < 15,000). The choice of N here specifies how many variables will be created that can be used as predictors in a machine learning model, and could be used as a tuning parameter. The trade-off in choosing N relates to the desire to retain more information in the predictors (larger N), vs. the ability of the machine learning algorithm to cope with a larger number of predictors (in terms of both computational time and also model stability).\n"
